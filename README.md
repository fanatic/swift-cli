# swift-cli #

swift-cli provides pipelined streaming access to OpenStack Swift

It is designed for high speed transfer of large objects into and out of OpenStack Swift. Streaming support allows for usage like:

    $ tar -czf - <my_dir/> | scli put <container>/<object>    
    $ scli get <container>/<object> | tar -zx

## Installation ##

swift-cli is written in Go and requires a Go installation. It can be installed with `go get` to download and compile it from source. To install the command-line tool, `scli`:

    $ go get github.com/fanatic/swift-cli
    $ go build -o scli github.com/fanatic/swift-cli

## Usage: ##

    version                   Print version information and quit
    ls [container[/object]]   list containers or objects
    put container[/object]    upload (put) an object
    get container[/object]    download (get) an object
    delete container[/object] delete an object
    help [command]            Help about any command

    Available Flags:
      -D, --debug=false: Enable debug mode

 Set Swift keys as environment Variables:

    $ export ST_AUTH=http://localhost:8080/auth/v1.0
    $ export ST_USER=test:tester
    $ export ST_KEY=testing

 If running from a statically compiled binary in a sratch based container, you can have swift-cli use embedded x509 keys:

    $ export ST_X509=embedded

## Odds and Ends ##
This is a WIP that does one thing relatively well: managing dynamic large objects in swift.  Currently it only supports stdin and stdout.

Borrows upload logic from rlmcpherson's s3gof3r (https://github.com/rlmcpherson/s3gof3r)

Leverages the well-written golang swift library (http://github.com/ncw/swift)

Would probably be better to use Static Large Objects, but requires middleware support on the server.

I'd love to add "append" support to infinitely stream logs (update static manifest after every uploaded chunk and on ctrl+c) or to "concatenate" a file to an existing object.
